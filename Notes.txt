Any branch (example master)
A regular branch reference which I can move around myself

Any remote tracking branch (example origin/master)
They follow this pattern <remote>/<branch>
At the time you last communicated with this remote repository, here is where the branch was pointing
It's a reference to the state of the branch on the remote which I can't move around myself
It's like a bookmark pointing to last known commit on the branch on origin
Run git branch -r to view the remote branches our local repository knows about

If I make a new commit locally,
My local branch reference updates like always
The remote reference stays the same

To know how did this project look like when I first cloned this repo, you can checkout these remote branch pointers
For example, use git checkout origin/master for checking out the master branch of remote origin

Once you've cloned a repository, we have all the data and Git history for the project at that moment in time
However, that does not mean it's all in my workspace
The github repo has a branch called feature, but when I run git branch I don't see it on my machine
All I see is the master branch

By default, my master branch is already tracking origin/master
I didn't connect these myself, it is done automatically
I want my own local branch called feature and I want it to be connected to origin/feature, just like my local master branch is connected to origin/master
But this connection is not done automatically

To do this, run git switch <remote-branch-name> to create a new local branch from the remote branch of the same name
git switch feature makes me a local feature branch and sets it up to track the remote branch origin/feature
The new command git switch makes this super easy to do
It used to be slightly more complicated using git checkout where we need to use git checkout --track origin/feature
